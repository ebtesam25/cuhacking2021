What it does  
How we built it  

QnA generation:  
BERT, transformers and nltk in python, we used a transformers based approach to tokenize and generate questions from text transcripts of Youtube videos. This approach works best when the Video transcripts are coherent and therefore can be tokenized correctly. Straight fact listing type videos work best, rhetorical and philosophical analysis sometimes produces incoherent questions.
